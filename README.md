## Park Simulator
Simulates a Park and the locations within it.

We completed a main method that takes the user to the Park class. The park class asks the user which location they want to visit. We have four locations: a garden, a petting zoo, a basketball court, and a pool. These class inherit from the Location super class. Each location gives the user specific options for what they can do. 

We will fix up the errorsin our code, allowing the user to do things in each location properly. We also intend to expand the sub classes of Location (the garden, petting zoo, basketball court, and pool) to allow the user to do more things. 

Currently, not everything in each location works. The petting zoo and basketball court are functional, but the other locations will give errors if you try to do certain things.

To run the code from the command line:
cd to the location project-lily_amaya_stephanie_david/src
compile the files with: javac parkSimulator/*.java 
run the program with: java parkSimulator/Simulator

Also, when running the tests for the various prompting methods, you have to input something into the console. This can be any random input.
